## ⭐ Features

- 🚀 Fast: Configured for fast development.
- 💻 Easy Development: Development configurations like hot-reloading, all with performance improve configurations.
- 🏗️ Build: Build commands to ship light production code.
- 💧 Clean: Linting and Formatting commands to keep your code clean.
- 💻 Os Compatible: All the scripts are OS compatible.
- 🔴 🟢 Test - Testing framework with coverage generation.

## 💻 Usage
1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/es/) (npm and yarn could be used but are slower)

2. Fork and clone the repo then install dependencies runing
```
pnpm install
```
### Then:
- Add all your files in the `src/` directory.
- Your build code will be in the `dist/` directory.
- Run `pnpm dev` for developing
- Run `pnpm test` for testing
- Run `pnpm lint` to check linting or `pnpm lint:fix` for auto fixing linting problems

### To run the project in production run
```
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```


Use all the template scripts under the `package.json` file.

## 🤔 ¿Why this template?
- We all know the time and effort that must be spended in a node project to follow good code practices, including linting, formating and testing, the idea of this project is to group a lot of this good practices in a minimal template that could be used for many projects.
- Another common problem with typescript is that all the bundling and compiling is by default slow, using more modern compilers this repo introduce a lot of performance improvement, for faster build times and automatic test iterations.

## 📘 Core Libraries and technologies:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Better quality code and scalability with support for types, static code análisys, interfaces, decorators, etc.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): Automated testing library
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/): Linter for better code quality
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Formatter so all the codes looks the same
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/): For fast building, hot-reloading and testing.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/es/): For fast dependency installation.
